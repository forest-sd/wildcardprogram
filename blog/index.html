But research increasingly supports what wildcards have always known: breadth of knowledge and experience is enormously valuable in a complex, rapidly changing world. David Epstein's book Range documents how the most impactful innovators tend to have broad backgrounds that allow them to draw connections across fields. As AI automates routine specialized tasks, uniquely human abilities — creative problem-solving, interdisciplinary thinking, adapting knowledge across contexts — become more valuable, not less.
